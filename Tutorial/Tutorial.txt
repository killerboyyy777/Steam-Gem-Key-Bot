1: Go to the SDA (Steam Desktop Authenticator) directory. If you have encryption disabled go to step 3.
2: Open SDA and hit "Manage Encryption". Fill in your encryption key and when asked to create a new one leave the text box blank. This will disable encryption.
3: Head over to the maFiles folder and open the file named after your accounts SteamID64.
4: Search the file for shared_secret:"XXXXXXXXXXXXXX=", instead of XXX it should have a code there, it always ends with =
5: Do the same for identity_secret, it will look similar.
6. Go to config (found in SETTINGS folder) and fill in your identity_secret & shared_secret
7. You're gonna need a Steam API Key. Get it here:  https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey (if it asks for a domain name, simply put in 127.0.0.1 or localhost)

■ 3) go to SETTINGS folder, and right-click + edit config.js. Fill in all of the required fields (Take your time filling it all in and don't make mistakes, it's a very important step)

■ 4) If you don't want to host your bot on a server, simply go to the text file named 'How to start the bot'

■ 5) Once you're done go to the main directory and click on "start", or go to the text file named 'How to start the bot'
